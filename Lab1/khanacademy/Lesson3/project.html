        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Make the filling. Mix the cheeses with the egg. Cover and leave in the fridge for later.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> In a bowl combine the water, yeast, salt, and olive oil. Mix well to dissolve the salt and hydrate the yeast. Add the flour and mix to a dough.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tip the dough out on the table and knead for 5 minutes. It will be slightly stickly. Scrape it together occasionally and continue kneading. *Desired dough temperature 25C (77F). If your dough is warmer, then it will ferment more rapidly. If it is cooler, then it will take longer. Adjust proofing time accordingly.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Cover and ferment for 1 hour.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Fold.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong>Ferment for 1 more hour.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Divide the dough into two equal pieces. Shape into tight balls. Place on a flour dusted surface and cover.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Final proof 1 hour. *During this time preheat your oven to 230C (445F) fan off. Preheat a solid surface on which to bake on. Be it a pizza steel, stone, cast iron skillet, or thick metal tray.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Shape the khachapuri. Roll the dough ball to a large oval shape. Roll the top edge three times. Repeat with the bottom. Finally, twist the two ends together. Fill with half of the cheese filling. I baked them one by one, so the other dough ball was placed in the fridge to slow down fermentation.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Bake for 14 – 15 minutes.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 11:</strong>As soon as the bread comes out the oven brush the edge with butter. Place a knob of butter on the cheese along with the egg yolk. Mix it well. The yolk will cook in the hot cheese as you mix it.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Soak the rice. In the meantime, blanch the fresh grape leaves in boiling salted water for about 4-5 minutes; (you could also place them briefly in a container full of water with ice: to maintain their color) then set them aside to drain and dry.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> In a large frying pan brown the onions cut into small cubes; add the pine nuts to brown them a little: at this stage you should put the sugar (as mentioned before, I do without sugar).
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Rinse the rice for the last time, drain and add it to the pan; mix with a spoon and add the other ingredients and spices together with 150 ml of water.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong>  Cook the stuffing until it completely absorbs the water; turn off the heat and let it cool to room temperature.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> On a fairly large cutting board, open a vine leaf with the veiny side facing up. Now place a shaved spoonful of filling in the center (it must not be overflowing otherwise the leaf will break during cooking), but close to the stalk that you have carefully cut; first fold the side flaps to prevent the filling from coming out and wrap the leaf, holding it tightly between your fingers.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong>  In the base of the pot in which you will cook the dolmas, first place the irregularly shaped or broken leaves, and lay the dolmas on top of each other on several levels (depending on the size of the pot and the diameter of the dolmas). Add 4 tablespoons of olive oil (I put only 2 tbsp), lemon juice and about 300 ml of hot water (for the amount of water adjust considering that more or less should reach half the height of the dolmas).
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Once you have finished spreading them out, cover them with a porcelain plate, just the right size to fit into the pot without leaving any empty spaces: this will prevent the dolmas from swelling with water and breaking at the ends.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Close the pot with a lid “as tightly as possible”, cook over medium heat until the water boils; once boiling, reduce heat to low; check dolmas regularly: if they absorb all their water add some more (should be hot water) and continue cooking for about 15 minutes.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Turn off the heat and let them cool to room temperature or serve warm with lemon slices and parsley or dill leaves. The dolma is served.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In a small bowl, combine the walnuts, garlic, vinegar and water. Stir to combine until a loose paste is formed, taste to adjust for salt and pepper. Set aside.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Combine tomatoes, cucumber, onion and cilantro in a large bowl. Pour walnut dressing over and stir until thoroughly combined. Garnish with the chili and serve immediately.
