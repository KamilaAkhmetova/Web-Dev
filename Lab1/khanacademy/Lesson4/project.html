        <p>My journey at KBTU began with my studies in Automation and Control Engineering during my first year. However, after much consideration, I decided to transfer to the Information Systems program, seeking a path more aligned with my growing interests. <br>One of the most enjoyable aspects of my studies at KBTU is the strong emphasis on mathematical subjects. I’ve always had a deep appreciation for mathematics, and the way it’s integrated into our courses has reinforced my love for the subject. Discrete Mathematics, in particular, has sparked my curiosity and expanded my understanding of logic and problem-solving.<br>Alongside mathematics, I’ve developed a keen interest in programming. Object-Oriented Programming, which I studied last semester, was one of the highlights of my academic journey so far. I found it not only challenging but also incredibly rewarding as I delved into the core concepts of the discipline.<br>Throughout my time at KBTU, I’ve gained more than just academic knowledge. I’ve made lasting friendships, created warm memories, and discovered new areas of interest that will shape my future career. The journey has been transformative, and I look forward to all the opportunities that lie ahead.
